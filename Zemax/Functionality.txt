To Do:
 - Turn this into a READEME.md and README.ipynb to explain everything
 - Look to merge Model_fitting_development and Image_modelling in some way
 - Doccument scripts in lib/


~~~ Main Notebooks ~~~

Model_fitting_development:
    Generates psfs using Fourier Transforms
    Potentially merge model_FT_broadband and model_FT_monochormatic into a single function with an input flag
    Should be merged with Image_modelling (used as a different method to generate psfs)
    
    Main functions:
     - pupil_phase_offset
         Used to calculate the phase change across a pupil generated by an off axis star
         Superimposes that phase across a complex array phase pupi in order to model it with Fourier Transforms
         Generates these changes using two model parameters (seperation and angle)
     - model_FT_monochromatic
         Vectorised version of modeel_FT for a single wavelengths
     - model_FT_broadband
        Vectorised version of modeel_FT for multiple wavelengths
    Bugs:
        - Either pupil_phase_offset or model_FT_... seems to have a bug that causes strange distortions on the formed psf at some angles

Image_modelling: (originally noise modeeling)
    Should be the main script to drive simulations from
    Much of this can be tunred into functions for func_lib
    Mostly does the same as Model_fitting_development but with accurate spectra and extra noise
    
    - Models Alpha Cen A & B with accurate spectra 
       ~ Main script candidate
    - Scales the each PSF relative to photon count
    - interpolates and shifts Zemax on and off axis PSFs
       ~ Candidate for modularisation
    - Accurately models noise procces of the CCD camers
