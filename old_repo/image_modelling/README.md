# Toliman image modelling

We've explored a couple of approaches to modelling the optics in TOLIMAN.

* Zemax does the most accurate, but is more computationally expensive and time consuming
* Poppy is a nice package, which does (on-axis) Fraunhofer and Fresnel propagation. However, we encountered problems with the Fresnel propagation giving unphysical results.
* Proper is the forefather of Poppy. It's design is less pythonesque since it was originally written for IDL, then Matlab, before being ported to Python. However, it doesn't have Poppy's glitches. There are some bugs in it, so you should use [our fork](https://bitbucket.org/brynjeffries/proper-python) which contains some fixes.

## Folders

* [toliman-proper](toliman-proper) has code to support modelling of TOLIMAN with proper. These files are used by the code in `batch` and `notebooks`.
* [notebooks](notebooks) Various Jupyter notebooks investigating modelling of Toliman.
* [batch](batch) Python scripts to perform modelling investigations without requiring Jupyter.
* [zemax_examples](zemax_examples) Some PSFs generated by Zemax to allow validation of Proper results.
* [ideal_pupils](ideal_pupils) FITS images of pupils generated from Kieran's spiral voodoo.
* [conics-doc](conics-doc) notes on how conic optics could be supported in Proper.
* [toliman-poppy](toliman-poppy) has some notebooks to model TOLIMAN with Poppy. These are kept for posterity, since we've moved to Proper.
