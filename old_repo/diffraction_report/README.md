These are pretty much untouched from Ben's original work:

* `bandwidth.ipynb` investigating wavelength stability of a star
* `poppy_toliman_test.ipynb` investigating PSF for Toliman rosette using `Poppy`
* `synthetic.ipynb` investigating wavelength stability for various band pass filters
* `synthetic-mcmc.ipynb` finding parameters from synthetic data using MCMC
* `poppy_toliman_doubly_diffractive.ipynb` fitting using least squares and Richardsonâ€“Lucy deconvolution (NOTE: some bugs - may need to revert to an earlier version to run properly)
* `diffraction.tex` Ben's write-up of the above investigations
