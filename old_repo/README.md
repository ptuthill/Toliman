# Toliman

Code related to the TOLIMAN astrometric mission concept.

This repo was started by Ben Pope to explore the feasibility of TOLIMAN, and has since morphed to cover modelling of the TOLIMAN optics.

## Files

These are new files added by Bryn:

* [`image_modelling`](image_modelling) contains all the code for modelling the optical system.
* [`jupyter_setup.md`](jupyter_setup.md) Bryn's notes on setting up everything to run the Toliman notebooks

These are pretty much untouched from Ben's original work:

* [`diffraction_report`](diffraction_report) mostly contains Ben's initial work.
* [`docs`](docs) is code to generate a report from the sources.
