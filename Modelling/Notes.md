# Modelling

## To Do:

- Build a python driver of Zemax
    Desired Properties:
    - Allows us to input custom pupil files
    - Perturb our nuisance parameters
        - Mirror alignment

- Begin building code to actually fit models

- Build 10cm Toliman Zemax file

## Notes:
- Brightness variation is also a nuisance parameter. Perturb in the main model fitting script

## Known bugs

- None! For now... :(
